                <p>With a view to supplement the balanced growth and allow them grow with creativity and confidence, liaison and leadership skills;
                     the students are equally encouraged to participate in different co-curricular and extra-curricular activities. The ECA also helps individuals 
                     to grow in body and mind and keep them fit just using leisure time. The main objective of training them with such kind of activities is to

                Students study helpline
                </h3>

                <p>Students Study Helpline is an effective spring that takes its origin from the committee comprising of academicians,
                     HODs, subject experts and counselors resolved to concentrate on students’ learning difficulties and behavioral shortcomings.
                      When teachers find consistent deficiency in students’ progress, they interact about the situation with the committee to come up with a plan to help them with personalized instruction and close monitoring. 
                    In such cases, students are facilitated with easy access to the tutors irrespective of working hours.

                       Career Counseling
                   </h3>

                   <p>Apart from regular classes and guest lectures on subject matters, the college does make a point to hold various career 
                       counselling classes. More often than not, teenagers find it difficult to fix their aim depending on their early age,
                        flickering interests and unstable temperament along with other adjustments that they are expected to consider. So, career counseling session is conducted to help them identify their potential aim and areas in which they can excel better and, make them informed about multiple possible ways to achieve them. Students can have lively discussion
                        with experts from different fields and thus have privilege to share their years-long experiences and expertise.
